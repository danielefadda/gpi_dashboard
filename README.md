# GPI dashboard prediction
## The world news tells us about peace

This is a dashboard to support the research paper: _Estimating countriesâ€™ peace index through the lens of the world news as monitored by GDELT_ (paper code can be found [here](https://github.com/VickyVouk/GDELT_GPI_SHAP_project)).

The dashboard synthesizes the most crucial information for the policy-makers and peace-keepers, avoiding complicated academic data visualization, and thus minimizing the cognitive load.

The link to the dashboard can be found [here](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/~dfadda/gpi_prediction/). Telling the story of the paper results produced through this dashboard aims to maintain the messages clear and coherent, providing time for processing and reflection, with the use of specific examples.

### Installation and preliminaries
This ``git`` repository contains the ``gpi_dasboard.py`` file to load the precalculated data you can find in the ``all_countries_xgb_results.csv`` file and generate the dashboard. You can find the dashboard in the ``web`` folder opening the ``index.html`` file.
